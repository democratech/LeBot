# LeBot

## Installation

Make sure you have nodejs installed.

1. You'll need a Telegram bot token from the [botfather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).
2. Write your token in `token.txt.local`
3. `npm install`
4. `node bot.js`

That's it. Search for the bot you created with the botfather in your Telegram app and start chatting (type `/start` if needed).
